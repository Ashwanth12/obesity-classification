This project provides personalized diet and exercise suggestions based on an individual's obesity classification.
Decision trees and recommendation algorithms are then used to recommend appropriate food and activity procedures according to the obesity classification.
The project structure includes directories for data, notebooks (for exploration, training, and evaluation), models (for saved trained models), and source code (with implementations of classification and recommendation algorithms).
To use the project, users can clone the repository, set up the environment, explore data using Jupyter notebooks, train and evaluate models, and utilize the recommendation module to get personalized suggestions based on obesity classification. Contributions to the project are also welcom.
